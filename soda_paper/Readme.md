To run the program, first download all the 4 files on to your computer (or) use the "raw" button on the page and copy paste the code in matlab.

Next, Run the test_bench.m file using this command
```
test_bench
```

Now , use this command to check whether the inner_location_loop is working or not.
```
[I,h_sigma,o_sigma,Z,tau,G]=inner_location_loop(x,n,k);
```

Note: You might need to install a toolkit to run the inner_location_loop

The final step is to use this command to generate the fourier transform of x (the signal generated by the test_bench.m file)

```
X=outer_loop(x,n,k);
```

To change the input signal, change the variable "x" and correspondingly "k" in test_bench.m

To change parameters like "B","d",etc. go to inner_location_loop.m
